    "## List Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is a feature in Python that allows you to extract a subset of items from a list, tuple, or string. It allows you to access a range of items from a sequence, which can be very useful when working with large data sets or when you need to manipulate specific parts of a string.\n",
