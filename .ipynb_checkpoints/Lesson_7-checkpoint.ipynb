    "# Lesson 7: Functions-- Void functions and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code into smaller, reusable modules and help make programs easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function names\n",
    "\n",
    "A function’s name should be descriptive enough so anyone reading your code can reasonably guess what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python requires that you follow the same rules that you follow when naming variables, which we recap here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You cannot use one of Python’s keywords as a function name. \n",
    "* A function name cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "* The first character must be one of the letters a through z, A through Z, or an underscore character (_).\n",
    "* After the first character you may use the letters a through z or A through Z, the digits 0 through 9, or underscores.\n",
    "* Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because functions perform actions, most programmers prefer to use verbs in function names. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function that calculates gross pay might be named `calculate_gross_pay`. What does it calculate? The gross pay, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples of good function names would be get_hours, get_pay_rate, calculate_overtime, print_check, and so on. Each function name describes what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Void Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a void function is a function that does not return any value. Instead, it performs a specific task, such as printing output to the console, modifying a variable, or manipulating data structures. Void functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and any parameters that the function requires. Here's an example of a void function that prints a message to the console:"
